The tool requires 2 input files : FDX_Database.xlsx and .a2l file (XCP mappings file).
The tool is taking all the characteristic a2l items and creates a list of them.
It takes all the trigger names from the XLS sheet.
As output it generates a capl script (.can file) that is mapping FDX triggers to XCP variables.
Idea is that some parameters to be able to be set over XCP.
